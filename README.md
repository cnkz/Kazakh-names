# Kazakh Names Pronunciation Project

This repository contains a collection of 1,185 Kazakh names with their corresponding pronunciations generated using the [TTS system by ISSAI at Nazarbayev University](https://issai.nu.edu.kz/tts2-eng/). The project aims to preserve and share the beauty of Kazakh names by providing easy access to their correct pronunciations.

## Features
- **Name List:** `list.txt` contains all the names with their gender codes (`M` for male names, `F` for female names).
- **Audio Pronunciations:** High-quality TTS-generated audio files for each name, categorized into five directories (`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`), each representing a different voice.
- **Online Platform:** Access the names and listen to their pronunciations at [Kazakh Names Online](https://www.kzhut.com/app.php/kznames/letter/A@0-2.html).
